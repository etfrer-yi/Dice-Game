# Dice-Game

This was my very first web development project. It
It is extremely simple in nature: whenever you refresh the page, the dice are rolled, and depending on their result, the message (draw or win by P1 or win by P2) is displayed.
I was very happy with the project when I made it: although very simple, it was my first project where I could see colors and images being used instead of white against black output (as with non-GUI programming projects).

Courtesy of Angela Yu's Web Dev Bootcamp for the idea, although the entire project is made by me from scratch except for the dice images that she provided.
